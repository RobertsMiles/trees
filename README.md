# About
In this program, I am fiddling with [graceful labellings of trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graceful_labeling). Since no two puefer codes generate the same tree, if I loop through every possible pruefer code on some n vertices, then I will have generated every possible tree on n vertices. With each tree, I loop through every permutation of a labelling, and check if that labelling is graceful.

Some of the trees generated by these pruefer codes are going to be isomorphic (such as A-B B-C and A-C C-B), so it would also make sense that these isomorphic trees would also get the same graceful labellings, so I will only be counting unique labellings.

This program produces [this sequence](https://oeis.org/A033472).

# Usage
compile and run with one argument, the number of vertices. Example: `./a.out 3`
